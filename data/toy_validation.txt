Giant oak wine barrels sit above the bar of the Cittie of Yorke in Holborn - which is more reminiscent of a great hall in a Tudor mansion than than a traditional pub.  The jury is out as to whether or not the massive casks were ever used as genuine storage vessels - or simply part of the inn's Tudor makeover in the 1920s.  The Cittie of Yorke features in a new book, Great Pubs of London, written by George Dailey and featuring photographs taken by his daughter Charlie.  The book examines the histories of 22 pubs. Take a look at some of them here.  On a quiet street in the heart of one of London's most exclusive neighbourhoods, the Nags Head's first customers would have been staff from the mansions on neighbouring streets.  "The likelihood is that, because of its location, most of the early landlords were connected with horses, carriages and stabling," writes Dailey.  The pub's main bar - with its 150-year-old Chelsea pottery beer engine pump handles - is unusually low, with short stools in front.  This is because the floor of the bar servery is positioned midway between the main bar and the lower back bar to the rear, which was once possibly a stables or courtyard.  The Nags Head is also filled with dozens of toys, penny arcade machines, posters and photos - and the current landlord's collection of military memorabilia.  The Blackfriar - built in 1875 - stands on the site of London's Dominican friary in the parish of Ludgate.  The Dominicans are known as "the blackfriars" because of the black cloaks they wear.  In the early 20th Century the pub's interior was remodelled by the sculptor Henry Poole, who created a vision straight out of medieval England.  There is a sumptuous mosaic ceiling, with marble columns and copper clay friezes.  And black-cloaked friars can be spotted just about everywhere - all appearing to enjoy sins of overindulgence.  The interior of the French House looks more like a Parisian backstreet bar, than a traditional London pub - and it remains a favourite of artists, writers, actors and photographers,  George Dailey describes the inside as "a little tired, faintly bohemian - but with unmistakeable Gallic charm".  For most of the 20th Century the pub's official name was The York Minster.  Its metamorphosis into "The French" started in 1914, when its German owner sold the business to a Belgian - but "The French sounds more romantic", says Dailey.  The inn on this site was first built in 1520 - on the north bank of the Thames to the east of the City.  It would have been a timber structure surrounded by gardens and marshland. It was rebuilt in the 18th Century.  Regular visitors included the writers Charles Dickens, Samuel Pepys and Samuel Johnson - and the venue was known for its bare-knuckle and cock fights.  It's thought the pub's strange name derives from the fact that a collier - a ship carrying coal - from Whitby in North Yorkshire used to moor regularly beside the pub.  Initially it was just called The Prospect.  For people heading to London from the south, Borough High Street in Southwark was a terminus.  The walled City of London was only a bridge away, but it was closed at night.  Latecomers were forced to take rooms at one of the local inns - including The George.  The George became a home for political debate and gossip - and Shakespeare's plays were often performed in its courtyard.  According to Dailey: "There is no pub in London that can boast of having a completely untouched 18th Century interior - but The George comes very close."  The current building, which backs on to the shore of the Thames, dates from 1720 - built on the site of a previous pub, which burned down in 1710.  In 1865, Charles Dickens is thought to have written about The Grapes - or The Bunch of Grapes, as it was then known.  He describes "a tavern of dropsical appearance... long settled down into a state of hale infirmity. It had outlasted many a sprucer public house, indeed the whole house impended over the water but seemed to have got into the condition of a faint-hearted diver, who has paused so long on the brink, that he will never go in at all."  Although rebuilt in the 1920s, there has probably been a pub on the site of The Ship since the mid-16th Century - and in its early incarnation it was known as a haven for persecuted Catholics.  The pub is now just behind a busy underground station, but initially it would have overlooked a rough area of pasture land - Lincoln's Inn Fields.  This narrow pub on the Thames is one of the best places to watch the Oxford and Cambridge Boat Race - if you can find a space to stand.  Anecdotal evidence suggests the Dove was actually a licensed pub as early as 1730 - when the green fields and orchards of 18th Century Hammersmith offered tranquillity away from the City of London, which was then only a two-hour coach ride away.  With all the hallmarks of a village inn, The Flask is very close to Highgate Cemetery - the burial place of Karl Marx.  It also claims to have two ghosts - a Spanish barmaid who took her life when the landlord rejected her amorous advances, and a hapless man dressed as a cavalier who crosses the main bar and disappears into a wall.  The poets Byron, Shelley, Keats and Coleridge were regular drinkers here. Coleridge believed the clean air on the hill at Highgate was beneficial in his attempts to cure himself of opium addiction.  When the building now known as The Lamb and Flag was built, in the mid-17th Century, Covent Garden was a relatively new urban area - a smart and desirable address.  But a century later, the gentry had moved away and the area had become a red-light district. Records from 1772 show that The Lamb and Flag - or Coopers Arms as it was known then - was trading successfully, but the clientele was drawn from the lower levels of society.  A century later, and the venue was a popular location for unlicensed bare-knuckle fights.  Great Pubs of London by George Dailey is published by Prestel.
Will Gompertz appeared with Huw Edwards on the BBC One Ten O'Clock News on the night of David Bowie's death  Each specialism within journalism has its area of breaking news.  For foreign correspondents, it tends to be a conflict or catastrophe. Politicos deal in shock resignations or revelations. For us in the arts unit, it is award ceremonies - and celebrity deaths.  An instant obit of a once great, but now late, talent is what programme editors demand from us.  And you can be as Boy Scoutish as you like in your preparations, but the artistic life - and death - isn't about pleasing the establishment: creative souls do things their own way.  So, I was not entirely awake on Monday 11 January 2016 when my phone rang around 6.55am. It was a producer at the Today programme.  Had I heard the news, he asked? M…maybe - I hedged. What news? David Bowie is dead, he said.  Oh no! Oh no for lots of reasons. Firstly, it was awful news. I loved David Bowie; couldn't imagine him dead. He was still making great records. He wasn't particularly old, and now - well - he was no longer here.  And then, oh no - I had to make sense of his incredible life, without much time to pause for thought. Six minutes later, I was on-air talking to Today's Nick Robinson.  I got home late from work that night, put Heroes on and thought… sad day, but thankfully rare - a once-a-year occasion at worst.  But three days later came another call from another producer. Had I heard the news…?  Oh dear. Alan Rickman was fine actor whom one generation fell for Truly, Madly, Deeply, in 1990, and a new generation got to know and eventually love as Severus Snape in the Harry Potter films.  By the time news emerged of Sir Peter Maxwell Davies's death on 14 March, we had already paid our tributes to Pierre Boulez, Harper Lee and Sir George Martin. All titanic figures, but at least they had led full lives.  This video can not be played To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser. Will Gompertz looks back at the life of "trailblazer" Dame Zaha Hadid  And then on 31 March, another shock.  Dame Zaha Hadid had died. I had interviewed the Bagdad-born British architect just a few weeks before, when she appeared as hale and hearty and feisty as ever.  She was frustrated with her adopted country, rightly so. Her fellow Brits had been sniffy and slow in recognising her brilliance - and now she was gone, still in her prime, before amends could be made.  2016 was beginning to feel like a weird year. A sense compounded three weeks later with the announcement of Victoria Wood's death.  That was a blow, too. We adored her. She was great. Always funny, jokes on the money; and never mean. We need such towering talents in our lives, not scythed down by the Grim Reaper. But he wasn't done yet.  Tributes were left to Prince after his death in April  The very next day, at around 3pm our time, social media stories started bubbling up speculating that Prince had died at his Paisley Park estate. Now, come on! Don't be silly. Don't be true. Don't be dead.  At this point, articles started to appear asking if arts deaths were at an all-time high. Columnists wrote think pieces explaining to us that it was all to do with our obsession with celebrity in a post-Warholian media age.  Meanwhile, the man in charge of obituaries at the BBC noted his services had been called upon far more frequently in the first third of 2016 than in the same months of the past five years.  It had been an extraordinary period. It has been an extraordinary year - with a sting in its tail.  On 11 November at 1:15am - a call from a producer on the Today Programme. Had I heard the news?  I knew he was frail and unwell, but there is something about truly great, unique artists - which he was - that you hope can circumnavigate that realities of live and death.  That pop's longstanding poet-in-residence had succumbed while still making fine work seemed unfair, to us and to him. He knew better:  You Want it Darker by Leonard Cohen (2016)  And so we went into the festive season. Surely Death was done?  Sadly not. In fact, he indulged in a Christmas rush with many unpleasant surprises to unpack.  The news about Status Quo's Rick Parfitt broke on Christmas Eve. George Michael was found dead on Christmas Day. And then, the following day Richard Adams passed away. So did Carrie Fisher, and her mother - Debbie Reynolds - 24 hours later.  I think it is fair to say 2016 was a most unusual year.

Gary Barlow has been a judge on The X Factor in the past  Gary Barlow has said the success of his new BBC One talent show should not be judged on TV ratings because they are less relevant than they used to be.  Barlow is using Let It Shine, which starts on Saturday, to find the five leads for a Take That stage musical.  Let It Shine will go up against The Voice UK, which has moved to ITV.  Barlow told the BBC: "I think people are ingesting TV in a different way now. That old system of ratings shouldn't really apply any more."  Speaking on the set of the show, the Take That star added: "But I think people are still loving, downloading and buying music and listening to music more importantly.  "And I think people are ready for a new Saturday night experience."  Barlow is on the judging panel with Amber Riley, Dannii Minogue and Martin Kemp  The eight-week show will be hosted by Mel Giedroyc and Graham Norton, while Barlow will act as a judge alongside Dannii Minogue, Spandau Ballet's Martin Kemp and Glee star Amber Riley.  The winners will tour the UK with the new musical for a year.  Audiences for TV singing contests have been in decline for a number of years. December's The X Factor final was the least watched in the show's history and lost out in the ratings to BBC One's Planet Earth II, which was shown at the same time.  The Voice UK, also had its smallest ever audience for a final last April, with 4.5 million watching, compared with 6.3 million the previous year.  The judges on The Voice will be Gavin Rossdale, Sir Tom Jones, Jennifer Hudson and will.i.am  However, Barlow, who was a judge on The X Factor for three series, said there was demand for another TV singing show.  "I think it's incredibly exciting," he said. "It's something I haven't done before. I've done lots of things in my career. But this feels like something new.  "And I have to say I think Saturday night needs a new idea at the moment. And I think this could be it."  Let It Shine is filling the BBC One Saturday night slot that was vacated by The Voice UK's move to ITV.  ITV has reinstated Sir Tom Jones as a coach on The Voice UK, two years after he was sacked by the BBC. The BBC showed the first five series of The Voice UK. Both shows start on Saturday and their transmissions overlap for 25 minutes.  Barlow refuses to see it as any kind of singing show shoot-out.  He said: "I've got to be honest with you. It's the same with music - I don't look right or left - I just concentrate on what we are doing and try and make it the best quality it can be."  Fellow judge Dannii Minogue, whose sister Kylie was a coach on The Voice UK, believes there is enough appetite from viewers for both shows to do well.  "I think they are really different shows," she said. "The Voice has really settled into what it's doing. I think it has such a fan base.  "This one is different. We are giving them the skills which you can take on to use forever. But then also it's a 12-month gig. That's a really big job for someone. You come out of that and you can do anything you want to do."  Let It Shine editor Guy Freeman, who is also in charge of the BBC's Eurovision Song Contest coverage, insists that there are good reasons for the BBC to have replaced The Voice UK with another singing show.  "A: there's gut instinct. B: there's an awful lot of research which says that people at the beginning of a dark winter want a real treat on TV, because Christmas has finished. Everything is finished and you don't want TV to suddenly kind of desert you."  Let It Shine is on BBC One on Saturday from 19:00-20:25 GMT. The Voice UK is on ITV on the same night from 20:00 GMT.

Radstock Street is being marketed as "desirable lateral living"  Buyers of a four-bedroom family home in London need deep pockets - but perhaps not as cavernous as a year ago.  Asking prices in the capital for these top-of-the-ladder properties fell by 8.7% over the past year, according to search site Rightmove. House prices grew much faster in eastern England and the West Midlands than in London, according to Zoopla.  London's annual house price growth for 2016 (3.7%) was below the UK average of 4.5% for the first time since 2008, the Nationwide Building Society says.  So has the London bubble burst? Are bargains to be had? Well, these things are relative.  One new development in Radstock Street in Battersea will see eight large apartments go on the market in February for £3.65m each.  For most people around the UK, that is an eye-watering price for a three-bedroom property. Yet, the developers say these homes will be attractive to downsizers - people aged in their 50s and 60s already owning a home in central London.  The idea of downsizing to a £3m-plus home might make those eyes water a little more, but Louisa Brodie, head of search at Banda Property, says these apartments are "realistically priced".  "They have car parking, a porter, and are brand new. Properties like this are rare to find, and areas like this have a unique selling point," she says. "London is still one of the most desirable places to live, anywhere."  This is surely a sign that London property has been decoupled from the rest of the country for many years.  Despite the drop in activity in London, the average house price in the capital is still £474,000, more than double the typical price of £217,000 in the UK as a whole, according to the latest official figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS).  The slowdown in central London is the result of the most significant change in the housing market in 2016 - a stamp duty surcharge on buy-to-let and second homes.  Since April, anyone buying a home that is not their main residence has had to pay a 3% stamp duty surcharge. This meant that, for second homes or buy-to-let properties, the rate for properties priced at more than £1.5m reaches 15%.  The surcharge led to a burst of activity in March followed by a steep drop in transactions in April - a "hangover" that still persists, according to Simon Rubinsohn, chief economist at the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics).  In Scotland, the equivalent tax - the Land and Buildings Transaction Tax (LBTT) - was also up-rated.  The new surcharge, alongside a rise in normal stamp duty costs for £1m-plus homes since 2014, had a bigger impact on the market than the Brexit vote in June, according to experts.  Ray Boulger, of John Charcol mortgage brokers, says it led to many at the expensive end of the market choosing to extend their homes rather than move. This made it more difficult to create chains lower down the market.  Ed Stansfield, chief property economist at Capital Economics, says the housing market recovered "remarkably quickly" after cooling immediately after the UK's vote to leave the EU.  He says a "degree of nerves" surrounding the economy and potential buyers' caution over stretching too far financially had kept a lid on house prices.  Another major factor in the market over the last 12 months, according to the experts, is a lack of homes going on to the market. This supply squeeze has meant that, despite all the other pressures on affordability, prices continued to increase.  The constraint on supply proved to be more problematic than expected, according to Mr Rubinsohn of Rics, whose prediction of a 6% rise in house prices for 2016 looks to be the most accurate.  This trend will continue, he says, spelling more difficulties for first-time buyers whose incomes may fall in real terms. Many will continue to rely on the Bank of Mum and Dad for help with raising a mortgage deposit, while others will look to the government's Help to Buy projects to find somewhere affordable.  Others see first-time buyers as key to the buoyancy of the housing market.  "First-time buyers still underpin the wider market. So long as the government continues to support them either directly via Help to Buy or by further tax changes then the market should not plunge but this is not completely in the gift of politicians who frankly have more pressing matters to attend to," says property buying agent Henry Pryor.  "Like last year if you already own a home then you are probably better off than someone who doesn't. If you don't, then it seems unlikely that 2017 will see a swift solution emerge."  The experts have a relatively wide spread of predictions for 2017 - from price falls overall to rises matching or outstripping the general level of inflation.  Martin Ellis, housing economist at mortgage lender the Halifax, is offering a hedge-your-bets prediction of between a 1% and 4% rise.  "The relatively wide range for the forecast reflects the higher-than-normal degree of uncertainty regarding the prospects for the UK economy next year," he says.  Given that a buying a home is the biggest financial transaction of most people's lives, they - and their mortgage lender - will want some certainty over their job and income before taking the plunge.
"Brexit means Brexit" is something we've all heard many times. But it's still not entirely clear what it actually means. If you're feeling lost, help is at hand: here's our handy guide to the A-Z of Brexit.  Known as the "exit clause", Article 50 sets out the process the UK will go through to leave the European Union.  It sets the clock ticking on negotiations, giving a deadline of two years before the UK's membership of the EU ends - unless all EU member states' leaders vote unanimously to extend that period.  It says that any deal negotiated between the UK and EU will come down to a vote of European leaders, where it will need to be passed by a qualified majority and passed by the European Parliament.  Previously tasked with cleaning up the continent's financial services, Michel Barnier is the European Commission's chief Brexit negotiator.  He's a politician with a long career as an MEP, vice-president of the centre-right European People's Party, French foreign minister, and European commissioner.  Mr Barnier is also known for not being keen on giving interviews in English. At the height of the eurozone crisis he implied this policy was led by caution, saying: "One wrong word, and we could move markets."  The European Council is made up of the 28 EU heads of government, plus the European Council President Donald Tusk and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker.  The council doesn't make laws, but the heads of EU governments can vote on the union's political direction through a process that weights their votes according to the size of the country they represent.  Although Prime Minister Theresa May represents the UK on the council, she won't attend any meetings or votes it holds on the subject of Brexit negotiations after Article 50 is triggered.  More properly known as the Department for Exiting the European Union, DexEU is the government department responsible for the UK's negotiations with the EU.  It is led by David Davis. The department will conduct negotiations on Brexit with the EU, as well as talking to individual states about bilateral agreements after the UK leaves the EU.  Academic Sara Hagemann, who is Danish, said she had been told she could no longer advise the government on Brexit.  Leave campaigner Michael Gove made waves during the EU referendum campaign when he claimed Britain had "had enough of experts."  More recently, academics at the London School of Economics said that Foreign Office officials had told them non-UK nationals would no longer be able to brief the department on issues relating to Brexit.  The FCO insisted that it was a misunderstanding, saying "We will continue to take advice from the best and brightest minds, regardless of nationality."  Trading with other countries without customs duties, import bans or quotas is the goal of International Trade Secretary Liam Fox, who has previously said that free trade "transformed the world for the better".  EU membership means the UK isn't allowed to make its own deals with other countries - deals like the Ceta free trade agreement signed between Canada and the EU after seven years of negotiations.  But opponents of free trade deals like Ceta and the proposed TTIP deal between the EU and US have claimed that the deals harm workers' rights and damage environmental safeguards.  Greenland provided the closest thing Brexit has to a precedent when it left the European Economic Community - a precursor to the EU - in 1982.  Greenlandic objections to its membership to the EEC, as part of the Kingdom of Denmark, centred on the Common Fisheries Policy which allowed European trawlers to fish in its waters.  Since then, Greenland's fishermen have fared better than its fur industry, which since 2010 has been barred from selling any seal products within the EU.  The style of Brexit favoured by campaigners like Nigel Farage, "hard Brexit" would entail the UK leaving the European single market.  It would allow the British government more direct control over policies on immigration, but may mean tariffs on exports to the EU.  It's often presented as the opposite of "soft Brexit", which sees the UK remain in the EU single market - potentially having to accept EU rules like freedom of movement as a part of the deal.  Nigel Farage said 23 June should go down in history as the UK's "independence day" in commemoration of the vote to leave the EU.  But a petition calling for a national holiday on 23 June received a negative response from the government, which said it had "no current plans to create another public holiday" because of the economic cost of days off.  Former Prime Minister of Luxembourg and President of the European Commission Jean Claude Juncker will be a key figure during the Article 50 negotiations with the EU.  Before the vote to leave, Mr Juncker warned the UK that "out is out", and that there would be no way back.  The European Commission is the EU body that will carry out much of the negotiating between the EU and UK, before a final deal is approved by the European Council's 27 non-UK EU leaders.  It's reported the Russian government of Vladimir Putin may stand to gain from Brexit, as the UK's decision to leave the EU could distract from its sanctions against Russia.  Former Bulgarian President Rosen Plevneliev said the UK had supported a harder line on EU-Russian relations.  Mr Plevneliev said: "If Brexit is going to be a divorce, we should stay the best possible and the closest friends."

Lord Kerr says Article 50 was drawn up in the event of a coup  Ratified in 2009, the Lisbon Treaty aimed to streamline the EU's decision making process following a period of expansion that saw membership grow.  It created the post of President of the European Council (currently held by Poland's Donald Tusk) and expanded the use of the proportional qualified majority voting system that awarded votes according to the size of a member state.  The Lisbon Treaty also contains Article 50 - drafted by Scottish peer Lord Kerr - the mechanism that dictates the way in which a member state can leave the EU.  The leader of the EU's largest member state, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, has said "Brexit negotiations won't be easy" but that there's no need for the EU to be "nasty" to the UK during negotiations.  German leader since 2005, Ms Merkel will face a re-election battle in 2017. Her decision to welcome more than one million refugees to Germany is likely to be a big issue in that campaign.  Norway isn't a member of the EU, but is a part of the European Economic Area, the European Free Trade Association and the Schengen Zone.  Norway has been mooted as one of the models a post-Brexit UK could emulate after a "soft Brexit", but Prime Minister Erna Solberg said the UK "wouldn't like" finding itself on the fringes of the EU after Brexit.  The Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orban is a strident critic of many aspects of the EU. Since the UK voted to leave, he has spoken of the opportunity it presents for change, saying: "We are at a historic cultural moment. There is a possibility of a cultural counter-revolution right now."  In October Mr Orban held a referendum of his own, calling on Hungarian voters to reject the EU's refugee quotas.  A member of the European Council, Mr Orban will be one of the EU leaders voting on the UK's Brexit negotiations.  Nothing to do with the colour of your UK passport, this is the process by which London-based financial institutions can operate in the rest of the EU.  Passporting became a concern for global banks after the referendum, as they feared they could lose their rights to access the European single market.  International Trade Minister Mark Garnier suggested that such a thing could happen. When asked if passporting could end and be replaced by something else, he replied: "Exactly."

US President Barack Obama: "UK is going to be in the back of the queue"  President Barack Obama enraged Leave campaigners before the referendum with his suggestion that a post-Brexit UK would find itself at the "back of the queue" to negotiate trade deals with the US.  Boris Johnson called his intervention "hypocritical", while Tory MP Dominic Raab called him a "lame-duck president".  In-coming US president Donald Trump has been much more positive... See entry below, for T.  The Commons Library says the position of UK citizens in the EU - and vice versa - after Brexit remains uncertain.  It does, however, suggest that people already using their freedom of movement to live in other EU countries are unlikely to be affected, as it would be difficult - practically and politically - to change their residency rights retrospectively.  The UK could give up its membership of the European Union, but still have access to the single market.  This would make trading with other European countries easier, as there would be less change after Brexit.  The price would most likely be some kind of free movement agreement - meaning that EU citizens could still move to the UK to live and work, even after Brexit.  The incoming American president is a fan of Brexit, even saying in the days before his election victory over Hillary Clinton that a win for him would be "like Brexit plus-plus-plus."  He has befriended leading Brexiteer Nigel Farage - who was the first foreign politician to meet the president-elect after his win over Hillary Clinton.  Some in the UK, including Mr Farage, hope a Trump administration will move the UK to the front of the queue for trade deals with the US, heralding a new economic special relationship.  The UK's nations and regions weren't united in voting leave - Scotland, Northern Ireland and London voted to remain in the EU.  Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has suggested she will hold a second independence referendum if the UK goes for a hard Brexit.  In Northern Ireland there are mixed responses. Some fear the return of border controls - the Irish Taoiseach Enda Kenny is planning an a summit on the issue. Meanwhile, the border town of Newry has seen an influx of shoppers from the Republic, keen to take advantage of the euro's increased spending power.  Former Belgian Prime Minister and the European Parliament's lead Brexit negotiator, Guy Verhofstadt, has suggested he is unwilling to negotiate on the free movement of people, saying: "European values will never be up for negotiation."  He has already held a preliminary meeting with David Davis (See entry for D, above) which the two said afterwards "a good start". And he has since warned that the European Parliament would negotiate directly with the British if EU leaders "don't take the parliament's role seriously".  Home Secretary Amber Rudd sparked controversy with an announcement that firms would have to publish the percentage of overseas workers they hired - although the government later rowed back on the idea.  There is also uncertainty over what could happen to UK employment rights, as some things like agency workers' rights and limitations on working time are guaranteed by EU law.  Police figures showed a rise in religious or racially motivated hate crimes in the weeks following the EU referendum.  In response, the government launched a new hate crime action plan to combat the increase.  Or more specifically, the yeast-based spread Marmite.  The falling value of the pound after the UK voted to leave the EU led to a row between Tesco and the manufacturer, Anglo-Dutch corporation Unilever, which wanted to raise the price of Marmite and other products.  The companies resolved their differences, which came after Unilever said the weak pound made selling its wares in the UK less profitable.  The capital of Croatia, the EU's newest member state.  The Croatian Foreign Minister Miro Kovac expressed his concerns about the effect Brexit could have on the EU's growth plans, saying: "We also want stability in southeastern Europe and we will work so that Brexit does not have too much effect on the enlargement process."  Croatia's fellow Balkan states Albania, Bosnia, Kosovo, Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia are all currently in the process of joining the EU.
